### gigas malware POC

hi gang so this #malware is so yaoi. basically it works like this :

#### step 1: it writes itself to the registry to run on boot
#### step 2: it will open notepad as a process and then inject shellcode to spawn a messagebox
#### step 3: it attempts to spread itself to other machines!!
#### step 4: finally, it will lock the cursor in place and prevent users from moving it around. 
the goal of this is to have fun and be silly wiht it...i tried to make it as defanged as possible so it shouldn't actually cause issues. microsoft defender pings it p easily too so it's not obfuscated. this is what i am going to be using in order to teach malware devlopment at my school next sesmeter!!
